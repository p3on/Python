# File Analysis snippets

Snippets that deal with analysis of filecontent, counting bits and generating images with the data supplied. 

I used this for checking the randomness of a RNG (claimed to be a True-RNG), this is a rudimentary analysis and does not determine if or if not there is true randomness within the generated data.
